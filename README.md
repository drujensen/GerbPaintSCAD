GerbPaintSCAD
==========

Jerrill Johnson from the G+ 3D community provided the idea of using a simple process to create PCB boards using conductive paint.  Watch the video to see how this process is performed.

This project is to convert a RS-274X extended Gerber Solder Stencil into a SCAD file that can be 3D printed using the process Jerrill presents.
