GerbPaintSCAD
==========

Jerrill Johnson from the G+ 3D community provided the idea of using a simple process to create PCB boards using conductive paint.  Watch the video to see how this process is performed.

This project is to convert a RS-274X extended Gerber Solder Stencil into a SCAD file that can be 3D printed using the process Jerrill presents.  In order to get the right dimensions, you will need to make sure you have plenty of room in your board layout so that you can add the conductive paint to the valleys.  Single Sided only.

Usage: GerbPaintSCAD {inputfile} {optional outputfile}
